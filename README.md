# Vets Who Code Application Portfolio

This repository contains the web development projects created for my application to the Vets Who Code program. It includes an "About Me" page showcasing my personality and skills, a tribute page dedicated to Grace Hopper, and an intake form project.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into the following directories, each representing a distinct project:

* **`about-me-webpage/`**: Contains the files for my interactive "About Me" webpage, featuring a forest background, multi-tiered dropdown Q\&A, and a book quote quiz game.
* **`grace-hopper-tribute-page/`**: Holds the files for the tribute page dedicated to the remarkable life and work of Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
* **`web-form-project/`**: Includes the files for a basic web form, developed as a FreeCodeCamp exercise for a fictional educational study app.
