# Vets Who Code Application Portfolio

This repository contains the web development projects created for my application to the Vets Who Code program. It includes an "About Me" page showcasing my personality and skills, a tribute page dedicated to Grace Hopper, and an intake form project.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into the following directories, each representing a distinct project:

* **`about-me-webpage/`**: Contains the files for my interactive "About Me" webpage, featuring a forest background, multi-tiered dropdown Q\&A, a small gallery of paintings and a book quote quiz game.
* **`grace-hopper-tribute-page/`**: Holds the files for the tribute page dedicated to the remarkable life and work of Rear Admiral Grace Hopper, created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
* **`web-form-project/`**: Includes the files for a basic web form, developed as a FreeCodeCamp exercise for a fictional educational study app.

## Individual Projects

### About Me Webpage

* **Description:** A small web page project used for an application to the Vets Who Code program and it is intended to introduce myself, and show my personality
* **Key Features:** Multi-tiered dropdown menu, a gallery, and a book quotes game.
* **Link:** https://github.com/Rhedonderon/Project/tree/main/About%20me

### Grace Hopper Tribute Page

* **Description:** I chose to dedicate my tribute page to Rear Admiral Grace Hopper because I was deeply impressed by her life, her monumental achievements in computer science, and the enduring impact she continues to have on our modern digital world. Surprisingly, I realized I knew very little about this remarkable woman and don't recall ever learning about her in my formal education. Creating this tribute page became an opportunity not only to fulfill the FreeCodeCamp curriculum requirement, but also to personally learn more about her inspiring story and a significant part of computing history.
* **Key Features:** A historical timeline of Grace Hopper's life and some major world events during her lifetime. A gallery of pictures with Grace Hopper featuring quotes from her.

### Web Form Project

* **Description:** I chose to model the web form project as an intake form for a fictional educational application because it offered the creative flexibility and freedom to design the questions and form elements in a way that best demonstrated my understanding of user input and interface design. This approach allowed me to envision practical applications of web forms. While this version showcases fundamental form structures and validation, I see it as an evolving project with plans to incorporate more advanced features as my web development skills continue to grow.
* **Key Features:** Basic HTML5 form validation, and a gradient background.
