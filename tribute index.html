              <div class="hidden">This nickname is not as widely used as some of the others, but it has been used in the context of her achievements, especially after her passing, as a term of endearment and admiration. The correct answer is Grandma COBOL. </div>

              <div class="hidden">That's right. Grace Hopper is most commonly known as Grandma COBOL due to her key role in the development of the COBOL programming language.

              <div class="hidden">This is another common title attributed to Hopper due to her foundational work in the field.
